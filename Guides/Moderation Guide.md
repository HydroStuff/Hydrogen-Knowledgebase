This is an unofficial moderation guide based on the official one which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YrFjt_2nTnl5Camm_bU2Lg8uq2NLXSr1FS67WBjIZ2s/edit?tab=t.0).

A person who starts being hostile should first receive a verbal warning. If they continue, then they should be muted for 6 hours.

### Hard Advertisement

Here are a few examples: "DM me to join a server" or "Just get NotHydrogen executor" (Not replying). Both of these should result in an instant ban.

## Spam

Unfortunately, the official moderation guide doesn't mention how to deal with spam, but it is against the rules. Most staff members mute for 3-6 hours based on the severity. Walls of text, flooding, and similar actions all count as spam.
