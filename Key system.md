2. Stay on the sign-up page for 45 seconds
3. Go back to the Work.ink tab

### PDF Editor

1. Install the browser extension (this is impossible to avoid)
2. Wait for the checkpoint to register
3. Remove the extension

### Opera GX

1. Click the Opera GX download button.
2. Stay on the download page for 45 seconds
3. Remove the downloaded file and go back to the Work.ink tab

### YouTube Video

## Extra

- Disable all ad blockers or any extensions that may interfere with Work.ink
- This shouldn’t take longer than 5 minutes (if it does you’re probably doing it wrong :3)
